# Frameworkless PHP Application
This is a PHP web application skeleton based on the [tutorial by Patrick Louys](https://github.com/PatrickLouys/no-framework-tutorial). It is using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for dependency management, [Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops) for error handling, Symfony's [HTTPFoundation Package](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation.html) as the HTTP component and [FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute) for routing.
