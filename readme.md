# Frameworkless PHP Application
This is a PHP web application skeleton using
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for dependency management
- [Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops) for error handling
- Symfony's [HTTPFoundation Package](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation.html) as the HTTP component
- [FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute) for routing and
- [Auryn](https://github.com/rdlowrey/Auryn) as the dependency injector.  


The project is based on a [tutorial by Patrick Louys](https://github.com/PatrickLouys/no-framework-tutorial).
